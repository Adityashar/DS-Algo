# Singapore Hackathon


## Situation

Me and 3 of my colleagues at DTU, had participated at prelims of an international hackathon which was supposedly being organised in singapore. now this participation was spontaneour

## Task

For this, we had submitted a presentation on a specified use case, which was related to improving the customer data analytics for automobiles. Now, all this was happening in a very time crunch manner, 

1. we had got to know about this hack few hours before the deadline, we agreed upon the topic or use case, we prepared the ppt just within the deadline.

2. getting selected was a shocker to us, and we had a weeks time to prepare for an international trip. we took this challenge gracefully.

3. at the location of the event, a usual hack was supposed to happen but there was one slight diff, we were one of the 20 finalist out of 800+ p teams who were given this humongous opp to visit foreign land with all their costs being reimburesed we were given 24h for building upon the system which talked about in the ppt from scratch.

at the hack, we decided on an ML-supported web application for this where we were using clustering for automating user grievances into the most probable solution, thus reducing wait time, and improving cust exp and satisfaction. 

I was tasked to work with the millions of records of data, they provided. Cleaning, preprocessing that data along with developing the req relationships between multiple tables, this data was then fed into the clustering engine


Hackathons are a normal event in india, but while i being a veg in singa, there was literally nothing for me to eat, so everything was done with an emty stomach, and this was my first hackathon, i was not even accustomed to being awake for 24 hours complete.


this situation of tight deadlines was so stressful, that many disagg had happened between me and my t. 

1. clustering.
2. task completion delayed, data was huge, pt inc.
3. locally or hosting it, not much time 


## Result

Our app worked seamlessly and secured 6th position.

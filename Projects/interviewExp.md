Hello Everyone.

I've tried to include all of my key learnings and takeaways from the whole process in this post.

#### Profile ####
2021 Grad. Working as a Technology Analyst @ Citibank for the last three months.

#### Interview Process

I applied for this position during the month of May and it took around 5 months for that job application in the portal to transform into an offer, certainly a phase one can reminisce if the final verdict is in their favour :)
<br/><br/>

##### Round 1: Online Assessment #####
I received the OA link from the Amazon India Team on 4th June 2021, but it was only on the 10th of June when I completed that OA because the link was in the spam folder (-.-).  I was reminded by a good friend of mine to check my spam folder, definitely owe this offer to him. You all should also check your spams daily or keep such good people in your life hehe.

OA was on Hackerearth. There were no screensharing or camera requirements during the test.

1. Priority Queue based problem similar to the K Nearest Points problem. (LC - Easy)
2. BFS based problem similar to Rotten Oranges. (LC - Easy)

This was followed by their Workstyle assessment of 15 minutes.
<br/><br/>

##### Round 2: Technical Interview - 1 (23th September 2021) ##### 
I got the notification with regards to this interview during the end of Aug 2021 where they mentioned that I had cleared the OA and that they'd be moving forward with the further process. 

However, the schedule of the interviews was not specified in this mail and tbh after experiencing so much of these "ghostings" and reading so much about such "ghostings", I  wasn't really expecting anything after giving the OA in June or when I received this mail.

I received the interview schedule mail on 16th Sept 2021, giving me only a weeks time to prepare while I wasted the previous 3 weeks lmao.

**Duration - 1 hour, Platform - Chime, taken by an SDE-1.**

**Q1**:  Linkedlist related problem. (tagged on LC as Hard)
**Q2**:  Array based problem involving searching on a slightly modified array. (tagged on LC as Easy)

Both are standard interview problems and had to be coded in their most space-time optimized forms. Try limiting the number of loops used or function calls while coding the solution.
<br/><br/>

##### Round 3: Technical Interview - 2 (23th September 2021) ##### 
This round happened on the same day at an hours gap.

**Duration - 1 hour, Platform - Chime, taken by an SDE-1.**

**Q1**:  Array question based on the sorting. (tagged on LC as Med)
**Q2**:  Binary Tree based path finding question. (tagged on LC as Hard)

Again standard problems, solved both questions in O(N) time and O(1) space (not including the recursion stack of Q2). Since some time was left, he started asking me some basic CS Subjects related questions.
<br/><br/>

##### Round 4: Hiring Manager (7th October 2021) ##### 
Initially, my HM and BR round were both scheduled for 4th October 2021, but I hadn't received any communication for the same so they had to be rescheduled. 

My HM round was taken by a very senior person with around 18-20 years of experience. He was a really nice guy on contrary to the "arrogant" HMs about whom we read on leetcode and blind. He even called me up on 4th Oct 2021 when I didn't show up for the interview and assured the rescheduling.

**Duration - 1 hour, Platform - Chime**

Only LP related questions were asked. The stories had to be to the point, just don't dilly-dally. He may even ask indepth questions related to your projects or give new scenarios where those projects can be used. I was able to answer these.

<br/><br/>

##### Round 5: Bar Raiser (18th October 2021) ##### 

**Duration - 1 hour, Platform - Chime**

This round was taken by an SDE-2 with 4 yoe. Started with his introduction and then moved on to the DS/Algo problem.

**Q**: Binary tree based problem related to the comparison of two kinds (boundary & non-boundary) of nodes in the tree. It had to be done in a single traversal with linear time and minimal space needs. I gave a postorder based solution for the same, he seemed satisfied. I would rate this question as an LC medium.

He asked a single problem, dry running took a bit longer since the recursion was deep and complex. Next, he moved on to the LPs. Tried "grilling" me on those, but I was able to handle it well.

##### Got a call from the recruiter the next day who told me that i was selected :) #####

##### Learnings and Preparation #####

1. Leetcode count: 616 - (127, 404, 85)
	- It is important to do atleast 2-3 problems everyday because once this practise stops, it becomes really tough to redevelop the same problem solving ability.
	
	- I made topicwise lists for myself, which are different from the lists curated by those youtubers. For the interviews, I went through these lists instead of doing anything new. You should be thorough with each of the standard interview problems, their different approaches and the most optimized forms.

	- Keep notes of the different CS Subjects, there is a 5% chance that the interviewer might just take up these topics. Mine did, but since I had solved the DS problems, the theory questions didn't matter much in the process.
	
	- If possible, then make md files for small topics like Binary Search, BST or Sliding Window. Include all of the basics to the most common interview problems, their solutions and your learnings of that problem in this md file. Skim through this file once before the interview instead of opening each question on LC. Saves a lot of time.
	- Practise dry running the code once on different test cases. Constant grilling by the interviewer can sometimes make this process pretty stressful.

2. LP :
	- For LP preparation, think of atleast 6-7 stories, articulate them in accordance with the STAR method, map these stories to the 14 amazon leadership principles (keep 3-4 principles for each story) and make a thorough study of these stories before the interview, because the interviewers can literally ask anything and you just can't afford to be silent while he has asked something. 

	- Having a conversation and keeping the interviewer engaged is the most important thing in such Behavioral Interviews because the only thing that is being judged here is your communication skills and if you get stuck somewhere while speaking then it can definitely lead to your rejection.
	
	- I prepared a list of all the possible LP questions from different interview experiences and mapped my stories to these questions.

3.  Taking follow ups from the HR during the recruitment process is the most important thing. Drop them mails regularly, give them a call once in 2-3 days if you have their number. Most of them, especially in amazon, have a pretty draining schedule so they might miss out on you.


Best of luck to everyone. Always remember that you'd achieve everything that you deserve, just stay motivated and confident.
